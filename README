About:
This project is based on the UniCString project(https://github.com/vycasas/unicstring). The "unistringxx" project is a
C++11 or later Unicode strings library which mimics the standard strings library's interface (unlike UniCString). Tests
are written using Google Test (https://code.google.com/p/googletest/).

Building:
This project requires CMake. The following describes the simplest way of building the project:

1. Create an out-of-source build directory:
    > mkdir build

2. Go into the build directory and invoke CMake while telling it where the root source directory is.
    > cd build
    > cmake /path/to/unistringxx/root/source/directory

3. Run make and make install
    > make
    > sudo make install

4. If you wish to run the tests, the Google Test framework is required. If the source is ready, it is possible to pass
    the option GTEST_SRC_DIR to CMake to allow the project to build and link with Google Test. To run the tests, simply
    issue:

    > make check

You can configure the build parameters by passing options or other arguments to CMake. Additionally, you can also use
the curses version of CMake (ccmake) or the Qt-based GUI (cmake-gui).
